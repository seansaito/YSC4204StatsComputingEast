The graph illustrates and labels the steps taken by the algorithm. Here is how it works:

1 -3: BUILD uses the default stepsize to find points (1.1,0) and (1,0.1) from the initial guess of (1,0) to build the simplex.

EXTENSION: 2 here is the worst guess (-7.26), and this is reflected to 4 (-4.97). Since 4 is now the best estimate, (f < VR), this is extended to point 5 (-4.0125). 5 is kept since it is a better guess than 4.

EXTENSION: 3 (-6.11) is now the worst guess, and is reflected to 6 (-3.89), and extended to 7 (-2.96).

EXTENSION: Likewise, 1 (-6) is reflected to 8 (-1.70) and extended to 9 (-0.70).

REFLECTION: 5 is reflected to 10 (-0.29) and extended to 11 (-11.17), but as 11 is now the worst guess, this is discarded to keep 10.

HI-REDUCTION: 7 is reflected to 12 (-32.91), but since 12 is a bad guess, we perform a hi-side or inner reduction to move 7 (-2.96) to 13 (-1.34), improving $x_worst$.

LO-REDUCTION: Next we reflect 13 (-1.34) to get 14 (-1.27). Since this falls between $x_worst$ and $x_bad$, we perform an outer reduction to get 15 (-0.33), the current best value.
